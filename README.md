# Movie-recommendation-Web-application-flask-
This project encompasses the entire pipeline of building a content-based movie recommendation system, from data preprocessing to creating interactive web application. Leveraging machine learning and NLP algorithms, along with web development technologies, we've created an end-to-end solution for recommending movies based on user preferences.

## Technologies Used:
**Flask**: Used as the web application framework to serve our recommendation system. \
**HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript**: Implemented the frontend of the web application for an interactive user experience. \
**Machine Learning & NLP Algorithms**: Employed count vectorizer and cosine similarity algorithms for training the recommendation model. \
**TMDB API**: Utilized TMDB API to fetch movie images and information directly from the website.

## Features:
**Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on their similarity to movies the user has liked previously. \
**Interactive User Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input preferences and receive personalized recommendations. \
**Dynamic Data Retrieval**: Retrieves up-to-date movie information and images using the TMDB API.
