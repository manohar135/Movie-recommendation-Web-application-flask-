# Movie-recommendation-Web-application-flask-
This project encompasses the entire pipeline of building a content-based movie recommendation system, from data preprocessing to creating interactive web application. Leveraging machine learning and NLP algorithms, along with web development technologies, we've created an end-to-end solution for recommending movies based on user preferences.

## Technologies Used:
Flask: Used as the web application framework to serve our recommendation system.
HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript: Implemented the frontend of the web application for an interactive user experience.
Machine Learning & NLP Algorithms: Employed count vectorizer and cosine similarity algorithms for training the recommendation model.
TMDB API: Utilized TMDB API to fetch movie images and information directly from the website.
